This project implements a full classical computer vision pipeline entirely at the pixel level without using built-in filtering or feature extraction libraries. The work includes manual 2D convolution with Gaussian and mean filters, separable smoothing, and gradient-based edge detection with thresholding. A Harris corner detector was developed using smoothed second-moment matrices, followed by non-maxima suppression to localize feature points. For each detected corner, an 8-bin rotation-normalized gradient-direction histogram was computed as a local feature descriptor. Matching descriptors between two related images enabled estimation of the 2D affine transformation parameters using a linear least-squares formulation.
